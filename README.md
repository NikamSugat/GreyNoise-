# GreyNoise

GreyNoise is a cybersecurity intelligence platform that specializes in providing clarity amidst the vast amount of internet background noise. Internet background noise refers to the continuous stream of network traffic and scanning activities that occur across the internet, often without malicious intent. This noise can make it challenging for security professionals to distinguish between harmless, routine activities and potentially malicious behavior.

The key purpose of GreyNoise is to filter out this background noise, allowing security teams to focus on identifying and addressing genuine threats. The platform achieves this by monitoring and analyzing a broad range of internet-wide data, such as scanning and attack patterns, without focusing on specific targets. Instead of concentrating solely on known threats or indicators of compromise, GreyNoise looks at the broader internet landscape to identify patterns and behaviors that might indicate malicious intent.

GreyNoise provides users with actionable threat intelligence by categorizing and classifying internet-wide scanning and attack data. It distinguishes between benign scanners, such as those used by search engines or security researchers, and potentially malicious scanners seeking vulnerable systems. By doing so, GreyNoise helps security professionals prioritize their efforts, directing their attention to activities that pose a real risk to their networks.

In summary, GreyNoise acts as a valuable tool for cybersecurity teams by reducing noise and providing context to internet-wide scanning activities, allowing them to focus on genuine threats and strengthen their overall security posture.
